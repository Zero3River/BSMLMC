Haskell, as a functional programming language, 
emphasizes purity (no side effects) and immutability (no data modification). 
This makes Haskell particularly well-suited for handling logical systems, 
as it provides a clean and efficient way to model and manipulate abstract structures. 

BSML is a non-classical modal logic system within formal semantics. This project implements a model checker based on Haskell, 
using QuickCheck to verify the reliability of the implementation. 
Additionally, a webpage interface has been created to facilitate user interaction. 

Chapter 2 introduces the linguistic background and motivation of BSML, 
as well as the systemâ€™s key non-classical aspects. 
Chapter 3.4 covers the syntax and semantics of BSML, along with the Haskell implementation, 
which also constitutes the core of the model checker. 
Chapter 5 explains the web implementation and provides usage examples.
