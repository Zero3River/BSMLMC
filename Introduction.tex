Haskell, as a functional programming language, 
emphasizes purity (no side effects) and immutability (no data modification). 
This makes Haskell particularly well-suited for handling logical systems, 
as it provides a clean and efficient way to model and manipulate abstract structures. 

BSML is a non-classical modal logic system within formal semantics. This project implements a model checker in Haskell, 
using QuickCheck to verify the reliability of the implementation. 
Additionally, a webpage interface has been created to facilitate user interaction. 

Chapter 2 introduces the linguistic background and motivation behind BSML, along with the system's key non-classical aspects. 
Chapter 3 delves into the syntax and semantics of BSML, as well as the Haskell implementation, which forms the core of the model checker. 
Chapter 4 introduces QuickCheck. 
Finally, Chapter 5 explains the web implementation and provides practical usage examples.
