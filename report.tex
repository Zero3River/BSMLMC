\begin{abstract}

    Bilateral State-based Modal Logic (BSML), proposed by \citet{Aloni2024}, 
    extends classical modal logic by adopting state-based semantics and introducing a non-emptiness atom to account for free choice inferences in natural language. 
    This project focuses on developing a Haskell-based model checker for BSML.\@  
    We begin with a breif introduction to the motivation and semantics of the framework, followed by a discussion of its implementation in Haskell.\@ 
    Additionally, we use QuickCheck to verify several key properties about BSML.\@ 
    Finally, we present a web interface that allows users to interact with the model checker and explore BSML.\@
